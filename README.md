**Description:** <br>
Spectral analysis of radar echoes through spectral moment estimation allowing us to find velocity of air at different levels in atmosphere. Doppler shift in back scattered signal is used to find velocity of air. By adding a sound source find speed of sound at different levels which in turn depends on temperature. Thus allowing us to find temperature at different levels.
